Linux Application Layer Test
Create two threads that share a 64 byte data buffer
Thread one should create random characters with a random number of characters (1- 50 characters
created at a time) and append them to the data buffer. If the number of characters to insert is
larger than the available buffer size, the thread should wait for enough space to be available, not drop the data.
The second thread should consume/remove a random number of characters (from 0 characters to
the number of available characters) and print them to any disk log file.
To make this test easier, we would suggest implementing on a PC edition of Linux, not an embedded environment.
The application should be written in language C and can be built by GCC.
